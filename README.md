# Data Visualizations

I first did a deep dive into data viz (and learned to love ggplot2) while participating in the [Data Challenge Lab](https://datalab.stanford.edu/) at Stanford. 

It's been a few years since then, so I figured I'd exercise my data viz muscles again. Each folder in this repo contains R markdown files, with some EDA and more polished visualizations.

## Some example visualizations
